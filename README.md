# Install

**STEP 1**: Install and upgrade with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/quickstart/).

```
$ pip install --upgrade texlite
```

**STEP 2**: Install (if not already installed) a [distribution of TeX](https://www.latex-project.org/get/). Recommendations:
- On Windows, *MikTeX* can be installed from [its official downloads page](https://miktex.org/download).
- On MacOS, *MacTeX* can be installed with `brew cask install mactex`.
- On Ubuntu/Debian, *TeX Live* can be installed with `sudo apt-get install texlive`.

You should now be able to compile your documents into PDFs with:

```
$ texlite my_document.md
```

(Or with `$ python -m texlite my_document.md`).

Use `texlite --help` for options and information. If you have any issues installing, refer to [Installation Fixes](#installation-fixes).

## Installation Fixes

If you're having issues with installing TeXLite, here are some fixes to possible problems:

- **Not added to Windows PATH**: On Windows PowerShell or CMD, Pip will not automatically add programs to your PATH (meaning that TeXLite can't be executed with `$ texlite`). You can fix this either by adding texlite to your PATH, or simply by calling TeXLite with `python -m texlite` or `python3 -m texlite`.

- **Wrong Python**: If `pip install texlite` is not working, you may be using Python 2.7, which has reached its end of life. Use `pip3 install --upgrade pip` and then `pip3 install texlite` to ensure that you are using Python 3.

- **TeX Live Missing Packages**: If *TeX Live* is installed and working but the document TeX cannot be compiled, it may because of missing plugins. You can ensure your *TeX Live* has all the plugins with `sudo apt-get install texlive-full`.

- **MikTeX Missing Packages**: When first running *MikTeX* on Windows, you may still need to install LaTeX packages. To easily install all that are missing, run `texlite` and wait for a prompt. In the prompt there's a checkbox to do this automatically, which may require you to wait but then it should fix your problems.
